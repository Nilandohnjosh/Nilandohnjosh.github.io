        <h2>The relationship between HTLM, CSS and Javascript</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>HTML, CSS and Javascript are closely related. A good analogy for these three is that you can say that HTML is the skeleton of a web page, CSS is 
          what makes it look good, so giving that skeleton skin, hair, clothes etc. Lastly, Javascript is what brings that skeleton to life, it gives it 
          interactivity, makes it move, gives it action and brings the page to life.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Javascript control flow and looping</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Javascript, the control flow is how your computer runs the code, from the top to the bottom. It starts from the beginning of wherever you wrote
          your code and ends at the very last line. Looping in Javascript is when you iterate code and making it loop until the loop is finished or if theres
          nothing else to loop. Theres many methods of looping, which include the for loop, while, for of etc...
        </p>
        <p>A good real life example that I can think of for someone who doesn't know Javascript loops, is to imagine you have a checklist to complete.
          An equivalent of that in Javascript would be like an array. You have all these to do thingys on your checklist, but a task could have its own terms.
          You could have a task thats only do-able at a certain time, or if theres a unique condition. You would go through your checklist starting from the start,
          and with each task being done you would go through that checklist and loop over once a task is done, going to the next, looping again and continuing
          until the checklist is completed.
        </p>

          <h2>The DOM - Document Object Model</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="text">The Document Object Model, otherwise known as the DOM is a tool that you can use to help create and work on your websites or web apps. It is accessible
          via the Developer Tools aka DevTools and is on most browsers. You can access it by pressing (CMD-OPTION-J on MacOs) or right click and selecting inspect.
          With the DevTools you'll be able to do so many things to that web page that youre currently on. You would be able to do things such as change 
          colors of the page, enhance the text size of text, and many more things that even someone who might not know HTML, CSS or Javascrip would be 
          easily be able to figure out.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/inspect.png" class="left" alt="inspect">
            <figcaption>As You can see in the image above, you can see various interactive options, but clicking on inspect is what we want</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <h2>The difference between data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Javascript, we are able to make things that can hold data. These would be our Arrays and Objects.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="/images/arr.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>This is an example of an Array</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
        <img src="/images/obj.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>This is an example of an Object</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Arrays and Objects are used in Javascript and they can hold items within them. As you can see in the images above, the Array holds three car items,
          Saab, Volvo and BMW. The Object hold three items with more defining items. The car object hold three properties with their values. Type with Fiat,
          model with 500 and color with white. They both can hold information but are used differently.
        </p>

        <h2>Javascript Functions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Javascript functions is a method that you can create that hold multiple lines of code. Once the function is finished with all the code inside telling
          it what to do, all you have to do is run the code and it'll be algood! </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/func.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>Here is an example of a function
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the example above, we have a function called HelloWorld and in it, once its called it shows a message on the web page saying "Hello World"</p>
