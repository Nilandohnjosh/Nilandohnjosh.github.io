        <h2>The relationship between HTLM, CSS and Javascript</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>HTML, CSS and Javascript are closely related. A good analogy for these three is that you can say that HTML is the skeleton of a web page, CSS is 
          what makes it look good, so giving that skeleton skin, hair, clothes etc. Lastly, Javascript is what brings that skeleton to life, it gives it 
          interactivity, makes it move, gives it action and brings the page to life.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Javascript control flow and looping</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Javascript, the control flow is how your computer runs the code, from the top to the bottom. It starts from the beginning of wherever you wrote
          your code and ends at the very last line. Looping in Javascript is when you iterate code and making it loop until the loop is finished or if theres
          nothing else to loop. Theres many methods of looping, which include the for loop, while, for of etc...
        </p>
        <p>A good real life example that I can think of for someone who doesn't know Javascript loops, is to imagine you have a checklist to complete.
          An equivalent of that in Javascript would be like an array. You have all these to do thingys on your checklist, but a task could have its own terms.
          You could have a task thats only do-able at a certain time, or if theres a unique condition. You would go through your checklist starting from the start,
          and with each task being done you would go through that checklist and loop over once a task is done, going to the next, looping again and continuing
          until the checklist is completed.
        </p>

          <h2>The DOM - Document Object Model</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="text">The Document Object Model, otherwise known as the DOM is a tool that you can use to help create and work on your websites or web apps. It is accessible
          via the Developer Tools aka DevTools and is on most browsers. You can access it by pressing (CMD-OPTION-J on MacOs) or right click and selecting inspect.
          With the DevTools you'll be able to do so many things to that web page that youre currently on. You would be able to do things such as change 
          colors of the page, enhance the text size of text, and many more things that even someone who might not know HTML, CSS or Javascrip would be 
          easily be able to figure out.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/inspect.png" class="left" alt="inspect">
            <figcaption>As You can see in the image above, you can see various interactive options, but clicking on inspect is what we want. The 
              <span class="important">DevTools</span>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

        <h2>The difference between data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Javascript, we are able to make things that can hold data. These would be our Arrays and Objects.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="/images/arr.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>This is an example of an <span class="important">Array</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
        <img src="/images/obj.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>This is an example of an <span class="important">Object</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Arrays and Objects are used in Javascript and they can hold items within them. As you can see in the images above, the Array holds three car items,
          Saab, Volvo and BMW. The Object hold three items with more defining items. The car object hold three properties with their values. Type with Fiat,
          model with 500 and color with white. They both can hold information but are used differently.</p>
        <p>To access items on an Array you would select the 'cars'
          object and use a square bracket next to it.[ ]. To select an item we start counting from 0 for the first item and onwards. For example cars[0] would
          select "Saab", cars[1] would select "Volvo" and cars[3] would select "BMW".</p>
        <p>To access items in an Object you want to start by selecting the object itself. In this case we'll be selecting car. Now we gotta select the property
          and out properties in the object would be 'type', 'model', and 'color'. Instead of using square brackets[], we'll be using selecting the car object,
          with a dot and then the property. For example, car.type would return "Fiat", car.model would return "500" and car.color would return "white".

        </p>

        <h2>Javascript Functions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Javascript functions is a method that you can create that hold multiple lines of code. Once the function is finished with all the code inside telling
          it what to do, all you have to do is run the code and it'll be algood! </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/func.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>Here is an example of a <span class="important">Function</span></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the example above, we have a function called HelloWorld and in it, once its called it shows a message on the web page saying "Hello World". You
          can have multiple functions that don't have to be saying hello world. For example you could have a function that changes the background color of an image
          if you click on something, or changing the text of something. Functions can do alot of things, there are even functions that work alongside key press. For
          example, you could press the 'K' key on a keyboard and a function could run code where once that key is pressed, it could scroll down to a specific
          part in the web page.</p>
        <p>Functions are very useful because it can take multiple lines of code and put it into a function so instead of writing down all that code to
          do one thing, you can condense all that code and put it into a function and all you have to do to call that code is call the function. You could
          have 20 lines of code telling you to do something, and all it takes it one line of the function calling it and thats all. Thats why functions are useful.
