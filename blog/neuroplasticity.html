    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>
    <p>I assume a lot of people like me are like the fixed mindset, where you’re stuck at a plateau, you think this is all you can do and are able to do, with no thoughts of improving. But with the introduction of Neuroplasticity and the Growth mindset, it’s really helpful knowing that your brain is malleable, that it’s proven possible that you are able to make your brain grow.
      Just knowing that you aren't at a fixed intelligence , that you can get smarter is helpful for what I would imagine a majority of people think.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
    <p>It’ll be really beneficial to embrace the principles of neuroplasticity for me by helping me grow not only as a Web Developer but also in life. Knowing that I’m able to keep growing my mind and intelligence is help towards me growing… Will make me successful in life . Not only in wealth maybe but in relationships.
      I'm going to keep an open mind and just put in the hours. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>No matter what keep practicing and practicing. You will only get better the more you learn and do it, and become smarter too. Mostly being aware of EQ
      is another way of improving your Neuroplasticity as they are closely related. Constantly challenging yourself and stepping outside your comfort zone.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
    <p>The Growth mindset is when you know are aware that with more learning and practice on a matter, you’re brain can and will expand in knowledge. 
      The Growth Mindset is when you believe your mind and abilities can be developed with hard work and perseverance. It's relevant today because I'm sure
      most people are starting to become aware of it. I personally know of people who have been made aware of it in recent years and become happier in life.
    </p>

    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>The descriptions of the fixed mindset surprised me because that’s how I feel a lot of the times, and knowing of the Growth mindset, I hope to try and grow into this mindset and grow .
      It is opening my mind up to the fact that it is possible for me to become smarter if I am aware of that possibility.
    </p>

    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>Practising and practicing and repeating learning patterns and being disciplined. Disciple is key for me so I will try to become more disciplined. I will
      try to put in more work. Taking breaks when necessary and not forgetting to take a break.
    </p>

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
    <p>Will help me strategise my method of learning now. I will try my best to adopt the Growth Mindset and become a better developer. I definitely think 
      that now knowing of the Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity will really help me.
