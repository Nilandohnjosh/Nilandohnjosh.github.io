        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
        <p>My culture has helped shaped who I am in many ways. The respect towards my elders thats imbued in my culture has made me very respectful not only to those older than me, but people the same age or younger than me. The values in my culture has made me disciplined and I hope it has also made me a nice person. Growing up I struggled with my identity, I had a bit of self hate for myself and my culture as a kid, due to being bullied a bit for being asian. But growing up. I grew to love my ethnic roots and came to embrace my Laotian side, with a big step of embracing myself ended up with me using my traditional name.

            My strengths are definitely my work ethic. I try my best and do the job the best I possibly can. A important skill I have from working is problem solving and that will definitely help me in this new career path as a Developer.
            
            A time where I was trying to work but there was tension is when at work, a lot of peoples ideas and solutions conflict my own. But by discussing and having a conversation with the others, we came to a conclusion that considered our opinions.</p>
