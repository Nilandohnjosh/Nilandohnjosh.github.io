      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        First, I’ve learnt that it is indeed possible for my mind to grow. Slowly it’s clicking for me and I’m really finding it fun. I personally don't
        have much of an ego but asking for help is something I struggle with. But simply knowing there is always a helping hand is cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I have learmt that I really enjoy taking a breather. I dont normally do any forms of meditation or anything of the sort, but we were
        introduced to several similar stuff during the core work and it is actually quite nice. The Calm website is really soothing and I am definitely
        looking to the yoga at bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, solving problems is proving to be really fun for me. Just that feeling that making something and solving an issue is REALLY good. For the
        sprint 5 carnival task, there were many times I came across a blockade and overcame that. Just thinking of a way to make it and then putting
        it to fruition is really satisfying for me and thats something I never knew I had.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Values such as being hard working and patience is quite important in both learning and programming in many ways. It's good to work your ass off,
        but also wise to be patient and understand that you can't just rush into a problem. You've gotta think and plan it ahead and use your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy and Self Awareness is also really important. Being aware of your limits or that youre stuck somewhere, it helps for you to realise that 
        and ask someone for help and being empathetic helps your communication with others. 
      </p>

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I knew that we would probably be reading some of the stuff in core, but it really surprised me how it is actually important. Learning to 
        code is great and all, but the core work was something that I feel like me and other people really welcomed. I was aware of EQ and Neuroplasticity
        for quite sometime but wasn't really a believer in it. Going through foundations has really opened my mind and welcomed these concepts.
      </p>

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The emotional aspect of it. Just the amount of content revolving around your Emotional Intelligence and how being aware of it can greatly
        improve yourself. I hope I absorbed alot of the content and try to use it in practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        To pump out not only great programmers, but also great human beings. I'm sure EDA tries its best to filter out ***holes lol and you guys try to 
        craft out good people.
      </p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        No I definitely don’t think that. I think that EDA had us learning the core part of foundations was to prepare us as potential Web Developers. 
        Simply being able to code well isn’t all there is to being a developer and getting a job. Reading through all the core content was to make us aware 
        of many things that I already mentioned(EQ etc..).
