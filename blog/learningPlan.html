      <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>This is my learning plan for Sprint 2.</p>

      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>I would like to begin a career in the IT industry, but more specifically I would like to start off as a developer. Frontend, backend or a full stack doesn’t really matter to me as long as I am one of those. I would like to gradually rise up in the ranks, from a graduate developer, to a junior and then to a senior etc. If a developer role doesn’t suit my future self, I would still like to remain in the IT industry even if its in a different area of expertise</p>

      <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
      <p>What I can confidently say that my strengths are is my motivation, perseverance and passion. I’m not the most smartest guy, I am a little bit slow lol. To make that up, I work my ass off when Im focused and try my absolute best. I try to ask questions on topics I’m not an expert on, I try to involve myself with others when I can and I always try to put myself out there.</p>

      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I would like to improve on my social skills. I consider myself highly introverted in a sense. I always keep to my self but I am able to talk to people normally but I always feel so anxious and nervous at times. I want to break out of this shell of mine and be able to socialise without feeling nervous. At all times.</p>

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. </h3>
        <p>How will I manage my workload during Dev Academy?  Well first, I would plan my workload, whether thats in my head or writing it down. I’ll first look at what I gotta do, then think about how I will face that challenge and try come up with solutions. I’ll try to ask others in my cohort for help and for their opinions and thoughts on the topic and I hope that they’d be able to ask me for mine. This way both parties are working together and we’ll become more familiar with each other. I won’t be shy to ask those at Dev Academy for help if im stuck on something or if im not doing well.</p>
        <p>If things start to build up, I will probably try to talk to someone about it. The last thing I would want to do is keep it to myself and hold it in , so ill try and let someone know how im feeling or where im currently at in the course. I’ve got friends and family to lean on so if im not mentally well I’ll try and reach out to them and if not, I’m sure the lovely EDA people will be great too :)</p>

        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>If im at any point stuck, I'll think for a bit and see if i can solve whatever issue I have at the time, and if I can't I'll reach out first to the people at EDA and also those in my cohort.
        </p>

        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <p>Great commuication and patience</p>
