    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>First of all, what exactly is Emotional Intelligence. Emotional Intelligence is the ability to use your emotions in ways with numerous positive effects.
      This includes overcoming stress, helping your communication skills, emphathizing and sympathy, and many more ways which I will expand on. Emotional Intelligence
      is something we all have and can work on that can greatly improve our lives whether it be personally or professionally.</p>
    <p>Being aware of EQ is mostly important because some people aren't aware of EQ and Neuroplasticity, the way that our brains continue to learn and grow if we keep working on it.
      People see IQ as a fixed thing where it determines our role in society. Im sure you've seen this before, where someone not normally seen smart does something
      thats highly qualifed such as getting a degree and people are surprised because they assumed that this person wasn't that smart so they think to themselves 
      "How did he do this???". It's because this person most likely put in the work and put EQ into practice, proving that hard work and practise can improve someone.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h3>
    <p>Well as I mentioned earlier, there is a stigma surrounding IQ that it is something that is fixed. Now however, with the recent studies of EQ and Neuroplasticity,
      people are starting to recognise the big difference. IQ can be tested in a numerous amount of ways that people will try to fix your intelligence. EQ is something that can
      beimproved on, using your emotions and being aware of it. If you are aware that your intelligence can grow and you put in the work, you will see that EQ is good.</p>

    <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h3>
    <p>It is important because if you are aware of EQ and Neuroplasticity now, you will be aware of ways that you can improve your EQ so that you can use it
      to improve your intellect. Not only that but it can help you become a smarter more compassionate person by being in touch with your emotional awareness.</p>
    <p>There are multiples ways to improve your Emotional Intelligence which include Attention Training, Self-Observation, Motivation, emphathizing and more.</p>
