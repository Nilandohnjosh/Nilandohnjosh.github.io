    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p>I feel somewhat confident in using Pseudocode. It definitely helps me think and plan out the code. Reading what I want to do in human form makes it easier
      to code.</p>

    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p>Trying something is a method that helped me solve an issue. Just trying to see if this works on a problem I had was important in determining how
      to make the code work. E.g In the fizzbuzz I couldn't solve the the 3 and 5 multiples until i just started playing around to see what worked.</p>

    <h3>Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
    <p>The Rubber Ducky Method is something that I'm already aware of. I often talk to myself when I am stuck somewhere and talking out loud to my self really
      helps solve the problem. This isn't strictly related to coding, but the Rubber Ducky method can even help real life problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading Error Methods</h3>
    <p>I really like the error methods. Seeing on the console what lines of code the error is on is really helpful.</p>

    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p>I'm pretty confident with using console.log and the DevTools because I normally use it to check if the Javascript is working. I normally use the 
      DevTools to see if my arrays and objects are working, seeing if the methods are working well before I save the code in my external .js file.
    </p>

    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>Googling is something that I definitely need to put more work and effort into, but Im algood with searching for the answers I seek.</p>

    <h3>Asking peers for help</h3>
    <p>I'm not too confident at reaching for help for my peers yet. I'd definitely be more confident once I meet most of them in person.</p>

    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p>I'm still somewhat shy at this, but reaching out to my facillator Naomi really helped me. I just gotta not be too shy at asking for help</p>

    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on what I've done is something I have to work on. I try to review the code I"ve done and re-read over it until I really understand it.</p>
